Hey so here we can compare and contras which project we want to work on.
The first option is SynergySpace: Working Better Together.
Description: Coworking is also the social
gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share values, and who
are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with people who value working in the
same place alongside each other. Coworking is an example of a sharing economy paradigm2
, a
socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and physical resources.

Pros:

Cons:
The second option is CommunityFund: Improve Your Community
Description: CommunityFund
is a community based crowed funding platform where people would fund community-based
projects. So both the fund-er and the project initiator has to be part of a same community. A
community can be based on interests or geographical locations. CrowdFunding is an example of
a sharing economy paradigm2
, a socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and
physical resources.
