Hey so here we can compare and contras which project we want to work on.

An important distinction to make is that the firt project its based on work environment, and the second project its based
Community.

The first option is SynergySpace: Working Better Together.
Description: Coworking is also the social
gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share values, and who
are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with people who value working in the
same place alongside each other. Coworking is an example of a sharing economy paradigm2, 
a socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and physical resources.

Main Users are:
* work at home profesionals
* indepedent contractors
* frequent travelers

Pros: 

Cons: 
* we have to account for more user divercity.
* I personaly find the context of this project a bit hard to understand, and quick confusing.
* reliability of the informal arrangements made between the parties involved
* Introducing reputation systems, enabling more informed decisions to be made about reliable and unreliable professionals.

The second option is CommunityFund: Improve Your Community
Description: CommunityFund
is a community based crowed funding platform where people would fund community-based
projects. So both the fund-er and the project initiator has to be part of a same community. A
community can be based on interests or geographical locations. CrowdFunding is an example of
a sharing economy paradigm2, a socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and
physical resources.

Main Users are:
* funder
* project initiator

Pros: 
* I find it easier to understand and easier to follow, it makes more sense to me.


Cons:
* come up with our own way for measuring organizations impact.
